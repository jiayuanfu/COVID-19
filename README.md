# Covid-19 Cases Prediction

This is a demo of predicting Covid active cases, new cases and death at daily frequency based on CSSE data by using DeepAR model.

## **Data**

The data used in this repo is imported from a daily report from [https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data).

## Tech Stack

- DeepAR

## Structure of the code

- **archived_data** : This folder contains the previously format of the source data.
- **csse_covid_19_data** & **who_covid_19_situation_reports** : These 2 forders contain the current data used in this project.
- **forecast** :  This folder stores the forecast result which generated by the DeepAR model.
- ****Generate Historical TS and Forecast TS - Webpage.ipynb**** : This is the model for running the prediction, which include forecasting the total active cases, new cases and death for a list of cities.
